# MbedOS_spadework
Record some of work on MbedOS. I might be focusing on trouble-shooting.

1. List
   * [Same code but different performance between WebIDE Compiler and GCC_ARM (Mbed CLI Compiler)](Notes/1_CompilerIssueBetweenWebAndCLI/1_CompilerIssueBetweenWebAndCLI.md)
   * [Declared global variables doesn't detected in the main loop](/Notes/2_HoardProblemOfGlobalFlag/2_HoardProblemOfGlobalFlag.md)
   * To be continued
      - [x] Why short main loop can't be broken with `flag interrupt`?
      - [ ] Check limited heap memory. (`Error Message: ####Operator new out of memory`)

2. Special Issues

3. Materials
